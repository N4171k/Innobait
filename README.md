# Innobait

## Project Overview

Innobait is a proactive solution aimed at protecting individuals from falling into online bait. The tagline "Click Safe, Don't wait! Go Innobait" underscores the project's mission to empower users to make informed decisions and avoid potential online threats.

## Problem Statement

The internet is filled with deceptive practices, including scams, phishing attempts, and fraudulent activities. Innobait addresses this issue by providing a platform to detect and prevent such threats, fostering a safer online environment.

## Challenges Faced

### Backend Development Struggles

As first-year students, we encountered challenges during the backend development phase. The use of Tesaract for text OCR in NodeJS posed difficulties, especially regarding storage and image processing issues. Finding the optimal algorithm for precise results added complexity, but our team persevered to maximize effectiveness.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** Used for dynamic functionality.
- **Tesseract (NodeJS):** Implemented for text OCR.
- **Multer:** Employed for handling file uploads.
- **HTML/CSS:** Created an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **NodeJS:** Powered the backend for a robust foundation.
